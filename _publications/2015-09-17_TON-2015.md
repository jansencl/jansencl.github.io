This paper presents a distanceless networking approach for wireless sensor networks sparsely deployed in large areas. By leveraging rateless codes, we provide distanceless transmission to expand the communication range of sensor motes and fully exploit network diversity. We address a variety of practical challenges to accommodate rateless coding on resource-constrained sensor motes and devise a communication protocol to efficiently coordinate the distanceless link transmissions. We propose a new metric (expected distanceless transmission time) for routing selection and further adapt the distanceless transmissions to low duty-cycled sensor networks. We implement the proposed scheme in TinyOS on the TinyNode platform and deploy the sensor network in a real-world project, in which 12 wind measurement sensors are installed around a large urban reservoir of 2.5 3.0 km to monitor the field wind distribution. Extensive experiments show that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for data collection in sparse sensor networks.
